# Ensemble-Approach-to-Causality-Detection-in-Financial-Text

Causality detection is one of the most fundamental and relevant natural language processing tasks. This task has a wide range of applications in various domains like health care, finance, and retail. Causality in sentences has variable syntax, making it challenging toidentify and define using a single grammatical model. I address the problem of causality detection as a binary classification task of finding whether a sentence has causality or not. Financial causality detection focuses on discovering links between different assets from financial news to enhance trading strategies. This paper presents a comparative study using different machine learning algorithms on financial text to find causality. I have also implemented ensemble models to combine the results of weak learners. I achieved an F1 score of 93.4287 with the Extra Tree Classifier.
